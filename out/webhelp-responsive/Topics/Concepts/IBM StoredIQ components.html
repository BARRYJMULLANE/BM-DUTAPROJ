            </h2>
            
            <p class="p">IBM StoredIQ provides three solution components: the gateway, data servers, and application stack
                (AppStack).</p>
        </section>
        <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Gateway</h2>
            
            <p class="p">The gateway communicates between the data servers and the application stack. The application stack
                polls the gateway for information about the data on the data servers. The data servers push the
                information to the gateway.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Data servers</h2>
            
            <p class="p">A data server obtains the data from supported data sources and indexes it. By indexing this data, you
                gain information about unstructured data such as, file size, file data types, file owners.</p>
            <p class="p">The data server pushes the information about volumes and indexes to the gateway so it can be
                communicated to the application stack. Multiple data servers feed into a single gateway</p>
            <p class="p">Data servers can be categorized in two types: DataServer - Classic and DataServer - Distributed. A
                data server of the type DataServer - Classic uses the embedded PostgreSQL database for storing the
                index. With a data server of the type DataServer - Distributed, the index is stored in an Elasticsearch
                cluster. Data servers of this type also provide better performance in search queries. They can manage
                much larger amounts of data than data servers of the type DataServer - Classic, thus making the IBM
                StoredIQ deployments more scalable.</p>
            <p class="p">You can have both types of data servers in your IBM StoredIQ deployment.</p>
            <p class="p">In addition to completing standard administrative tasks, administrators can deploy the IBM StoredIQ
                Desktop Data Collector and index desktops from the data server.</p>
            <p class="p"></p>
        </section>
        <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Application stack</h2>
            
            <p class="p">The application stack provides the user interface for the IBM StoredIQ Administrator, IBM StoredIQ
                Data Workbench, IBM StoredIQ Insights, and the IBM StoredIQ Policy Manager products.</p>
            <p class="p">The synchronization feature for integration with a governance catalog is also part of the application
                stack.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Elasticsearch cluster</h2>
            
            <p class="p">The Elasticsearch cluster attached to a data server of the type DataServer - Distributed provides a
                single data store for all metadata and content of harvested objects. Indexed data is distributed
                automatically across the nodes in the cluster. Indexing and queries are load-balanced across all
                nodes. Nodes can be added dynamically without downtime and the indexing process can use these
                newly added nodes without further setup.</p>

            <p class="p">IBM StoredIQ Data Server user interface provides access to data server functionality. It allows
                administrators to view the dashboard and see the status of the jobs and system details. Administrators 
                can manage information about servers and conduct various configurations on the system and application
                settings.</p>

            <p class="p">IBM StoredIQ Administrator helps you manage global assets common to the distributed infrastructure
                behind IBM StoredIQ applications.
            </p>
            <img class="image" src="IBM_STOREDIQ2.GIF" />
            <p class="p">IBM StoredIQ Administrator provides at-a-glance understanding of the different issues that can crop up
                in the IBM StoredIQ environment. These views are unique to the IBM StoredIQ Administrator application
                as they provide an overview of how the system is running. They allow access to various pieces of
                information that are being shared across applications or allow for the management of resources in a
                centralized manner.</p>
            <p class="p">The administrator is the person responsible for managing the IBM StoredIQ. This individual has strong
                understanding of data sources, indexes, data servers, jobs, infosets, and actions. This list provides an
                overview as to how IBM StoredIQ Administrator works:
            </p>
            <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Viewing data servers and volumes:</strong> Using IBM StoredIQ Administrator, the Administrator can identify
                    what data servers are deployed, their location, what data is being managed, and the status of each data
                    server in the system. Volume management is a central component of IBM StoredIQ. IBM StoredIQ
                    Administrator also allows the Administrator to see what volumes are currently under management,
                    which data server is responsible for that volume, the state of the volume after indexing, and the amount
                    and size of information that is contained by each volume. Administrators can also add volumes to and
                    delete volumes from data servers through this interface.
                    If IBM StoredIQ is con³gured for integration with Information Governance Catalog, the Administrator
                    can also manage which volumes are published to the governance catalog.
                </li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Scheduling harvests:</strong> Harvesting, which can also be referred to as indexing, is the process or task by
                    which IBM StoredIQ examines and classifies data in your network. Using IBM StoredIQ Administrator,
                    harvests can be scheduled, edited, and deleted.
                </li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Creating system infosets:</strong> System infosets that use only speci³c indexed volumes can be created and
                    managed within IBM StoredIQ Administrator. Although infosets are a core component of IBM StoredIQ
                    Data Workbench, system infosets are created as a shortcut for users in IBM StoredIQ Administrator.</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Managing users:</strong> The user management area allows administrators to create users and manage users'
                    access to the various IBM StoredIQ applications</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Configuring and managing actions: </strong> An action is any process that is taken upon the data that is
                    represented by the indexes. Actions are run by data servers on indexed data objects. Any errors or
                    warnings that are generated as a result of an action are recorded as exceptions in IBM StoredIQ Data
                    Workbench.</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Note:</strong> Actions can be created within IBM StoredIQ Administrator and then made available to other IBM
                    StoredIQ applications such as IBM StoredIQ Data Workbench.</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Managing target sets:</strong>Provides an interface that allows the user to set the wanted targets for speci³c
                    actions that require a destination volume for their actions.</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Reports:</strong>IBM StoredIQ Administrator provides a number of built-in reports, such as summaries of data
                    objects in the system, storage use, and the number of identical documents in the system. You can
                    create custom reports, including Query Analysis Reports for e-discovery purposes, and automatically
                    email report notifications to administrators and other interested parties.</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Auto-Classification:</strong> Automated document categorization, what IBM StoredIQ refers to as auto
                    classification models, integrates the IBM® Content classification's classification model into the IBM
                    StoredIQ infoset-generation process. Data Experts can use IBM Content classification to train a
                    classification model, which is then registered with IBM StoredIQ Administrator. The registered
                    classification model can be applied to an existing infoset in IBM StoredIQ Data Workbench to generate
                    new metadata for the objects in the infoset. Metadata can be used in rule-based ³lters to create new
                    infosets</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Cartridges:</strong>Cartridges are compressed ³les that contain analysis logic. When you add a cartridge to
                    IBM StoredIQ AppStack, it can detect new data in documents during indexing and make these new
                    insights searchable. For example, a sensitive pattern cartridge can enable IBM StoredIQ to detect
                    passport numbers, phone numbers, and other IDs.
                    To apply the analysis logic contained in the cartridge, you must run a Step-up Analytics action that uses
                    the cartridge on an infoset. IBM StoredIQ examines all documents in the infoset, applies the analytics,
                    and then stores the analysis results in the IBM StoredIQ index.

                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Managing Mule scripts:</strong>Helps you to create Mule scripts and upload script packages. These Mule
                    scripts are used by IBM StoredIQ Policy Manager to create policies using the automation workflow.</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">DataServer - Classic:</strong>Data servers can be categorized in two types: DataServer - Classic and
                    DataServer - Distributed. DataServer - Classic refers to the regular data servers. It uses either the
                    current PostgreSQL or Lucene index as an index.</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">DataServer - Distributed: </strong>The distributed data server uses an Elasticsearch cluster instead of an
                    embedded Postgres database. It increases the scalability and flexibility of the IBM StoredIQ
                    deployment in a way that it can manage much larger amounts of data. Without adding more data
                    servers, data that is managed by the IBM StoredIQ deployment can be increased by adding new nodes
                    to the Elasticsearch cluster. Search queries perform better on DataServer - Distributed.</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Connector API SDK:</strong> A connector is a software component of IBM StoredIQ that is used to connect to a
                    data source such as a network file system and access its data. Using IBM StoredIQ Connector API SDK,
                    developers of other companies can develop connectors to new data sources outside the IBM StoredIQ
                    development environment. These connectors can be integrated with a live IBM StoredIQ application to
                    index, search, manage, and analyze data on the data source.</li>

            <p class="p">Big data is a pervasive problem, not a one-time occurrence. It is easy for most companies to realize that
                big data is problematic, but it is hard to identify what problems they have. Big data is all about the
                unknown, but the unknown cannot be off limits. IBM StoredIQ Data Workbench can help you learn about
                your data, make educated decisions with your most valuable asset, and turn your company's most
                dangerous risk into its most valuable asset.</p>
            <img class="image" src="IBM_STOREDIQ3.GIF" />
            <p class="p">IBM StoredIQ Data Workbench is a data visualization and management tool that helps you to actively
                manage your company's data. It helps you to determine how much data you have, where it is, who owns
                it, and when it was last used. When you have a clear understanding of your company's data landscape,
                IBM StoredIQ Data Workbench helps you take control of data. You can make informed decisions about
                your data and act on that knowledge by copying, copying to retention, or conducting a discovery export.
                
                Here are just some examples of how you can use IBM StoredIQ Data Workbench.

            </p>
            <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">You need to find all company email that is sent from or received by Eileen Sideways
                    (esideways@thecompany.com). You can use IBM StoredIQ Data Workbench to ³nd all email and then
                    copy that data to a prede³ned repository. You can also use IBM StoredIQ Data Workbench to ³nd all of
                    the esideways@thecompany.com email that occurred between speci³c dates and then make that email
                    available for review.</li>
                <li class="li"> As an administrator, you want to rid your networks and storage of unused data. You can use IBM
                    StoredIQ Data Workbench to ³nd all ³les that were not modi³ed in more than ³ve years.
                </li>
                <li class="li">You want to ³nd all image ³les that are created in 2007. Not only can IBM StoredIQ Data Workbench
                    ³nd all image ³les that were created in 2007. It also shows how much space they occupy on your
                    network.
                </li>
                <li class="li">A user needs to understand how data about Windows is being retained. Using IBM StoredIQ Data
                    Workbench, you can provide that user with a visual overview of the number of objects that are retained
                    and a breakdown of files per data source. Additionally, you can apply overlays to show the user if those
                    files contain forbidden information such as credit-card numbers or Social Security numbers.</li>
                <li class="li">If IBM StoredIQ is con³gured accordingly, you can select the infosets and filters that are published to
                    the governance catalog for uni³ed governance of structured and unstructured information. When
                    integrating with Information Governance Catalog, you can also analyze and classify the data governed
                    by IBM StoredIQ based on the data classes that are synchronized from the governance catalog.</li>
